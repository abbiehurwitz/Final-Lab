The most difficult part of this lab for me was section 11. 
Theoretically I knew that I had to iterate through the keys so that it could work however actually implementing it was not working for me.
Part of the problem might have been that by this point I was rather short on time and my head was not as clear as I like it to be 
when working on these sorts of things. For this lab I would likely would not have worked with JavaScript and would have rather chosen 
C++ or Java. We’ve already done similar labs in those languages and I think that while JavaScript is interesting is only makes sense 
to use for things that you can only do in web design. Despite that I did enjoy being able to learn some Javascript. 
I have messed around with HTML in the past in order to help with websites such as my school newspaper in high school, however I’ve 
never had any experience in JavaScript and never would have been able to do anything like this in the past. The lack of types was
difficult for me. Having to constantly declare classes and subclasses as functions was something I didn't quite understand and 
while I'm not sure if it ever trapped me at some point I did constantly find myself having to check on how the syntax was supposed 
to look. Although it was in a different language I found the concept of inheritance which we have talked about before in class very
useful when doing this lab, especially for the ObservableStack class.
I would loved to have been able to implement the idea of a canvas so that the user could draw shapes. I found the idea very
interesting as well as something that would look good on a web browser however I just did not have time to implement the idea.
